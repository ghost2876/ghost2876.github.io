<h1>Hello World</h1>

ATTENTION: click View Graph for checking the graph, click View Gist for checking the html and p5js code.
		   It appears to me that sometimes in View Gist you lose some functionality such as hovering over the point, but it works fine in View Graph.
		   I assume that's because View Graph just opens a new window for the whole graph, while View Gist only shows the graph in a limited frame.
